/**
 * This program defines a few of the features available on a typical desktop.
 * In particular, the program allows for the creation of folders along with moving
 * and deleting them by dragging to the trash.
 *
 * The Desktop class creates the intitial display with the trash can image and an instance of
 * Button with a New Folder functionality. In addition, this class handles all the mouse events
 * required for clicking the New Folder button and dragging the Folders across the canvas.
 *
 * NOTE: If the folder collection becomes full, more folders CAN be created.
 * It's just that the user wonâ€™t be able to drag them. If the user drags a folder
 * to the trash, that will free up room so another NEW folder can be created and dragged.
